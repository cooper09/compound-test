# Compound scripts to
 1) supply Dai (or any ERC20 token)to Compound protocol
 2) borrow ETH using the supplied collateral
 3) pay back Borrowed assets
 4) redeem supplied collateral

Original scripts by Adam Bravosa:
supply example: https://github.com/compound-developers/compound-supply-examples/blob/master/examples-js/ethers-js/supply-erc20.js

borrow example: https://github.com/compound-developers/compound-borrow-examples/blob/master/examples-js/ethers-js/borrow-erc20-with-eth-collateral.js

The app currently supports ETH and DAI. The app runs a Hardhat fork of Ethereum mainnet and each script is run seperately. 

The provider and accounts which supply, pay and redeem are in the file modules/accts.js
(Actual values are in .ENV) but you can see how the provider, wallet and target accounts are available to each script seperatel. 

The JSON RPC provider URL is infura for mainnet and polygon and hardhat for localhost:9545


## To run simply run 

node getBalances - show current balance of signer wallet in Eth, Dai and CDai)

node supplyDai - add Dai as collateral to protocol. The default is 10 dai but it can be any amount based on the ammount of dai available (lines 54-59 )

node borrowEth - generate loan from the signer account to "target" acct, ie, if we borrow $10 the funds go to the target account. (lines 128-132)

node repayEth - repays the loan. Pretty much the same as original script except for account access.

## node redeemDai - this is where the trouble starts. Initially, the Dai is redeemed to the signer wallet but eventually if fails with "CANNOT DETERMIN GAS FEE". 

trying to debug the issue I have several versions of redeem with redeemDai.js and redeemDai-3.js as the most tenable while the others are variations on the original.
